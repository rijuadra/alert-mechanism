Problem Statement: Alert Mechanism System 
Build a Rest API application to manage the alert system mechanism where we need to alert a team and certain developers for alerts. Below are the endpoints to have: 
1. POST /team - create team which has (team_id, team_name) and list of developers linked to a team which has(developer_id,name,phone_number, team_id). Consumers should be responded back with auto generated team_id after creation. Make sure that we cannot create a team without any developers. At least one developer should be mandatory. 
Request Payload for the endpoint: 
{ 
"developers": [ 
{ 
"name": "string", 
"phoneNumber": "string" 
} 
], 
"teamName": "string" 
} 
2. POST /{team_id}/alert - take team_id in request and alert any team developer from the team and it has to be random for every alert. Use developer phone_numner to alert using below details. 
Use the SMS alert URL: https://run.mocky.io/v3/fd99c100-f88a-4d70-aaf7-393dbbd5d99f Request payload: {“phone_number”: “xxxxxxxxxx”}
